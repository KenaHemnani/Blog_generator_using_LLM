Are you looking for the best central government scheme in India? We’re here to help. Below, you will find the best 27 central government schemes in India that farmers can avail of to get some financial help and ease down their farming journey. 

### What is a Central Government Scheme?

A Central Government Scheme is a program or initiative that is implemented and supervised by a country's central government. These programs usually solve specific concerns, give advantages, or encourage growth in various sectors of the country's economy or society. 

The goals of central government schemes for farmers might vary greatly depending on the government's aims and policies. In India, they primarily aim to improve the infrastructure for farmers, enhance rural development, promote job creation in the agriculture industry, and provide sufficient funding to the farmers. 

### Why are Government Schemes Necessary?

Government schemes can help farmers in India in more than one way. From providing financial support to reducing financial risk, the benefits of government schemes are many. 

**TractorGyan** presents you with a quick rundown of key government schemes' benefits. 

  * Government schemes are necessary to provide better and sustainable livelihood to its citizens. With their help, farmers of lower-income groups can get capital to get started. 

  * Government agriculture schemes in India for farmers help the farming community in planning and organizing their farming activities prudently. Farmers get support, guidance, and professional assistance on farming that leads to quality production. 

  * Central government schemes for farmers are a safe way to get credit. They provide funds at an affordable interest rate and can help farmers to prevent debt traps. 

  * Schemes offering crop insurance help farmers to reduce agricultural risks. They can claim the loss incurred due to flood, disease, or any sort of unforeseen circumstances. 

  * Many schemes offer farm implements and equipment like **rotavators** , solar pumps, and many more at subsidized rates. With the help of subsidies, it’s easy for farms to buy modern farming tools and incorporate farm mechanization into their farming practices.
