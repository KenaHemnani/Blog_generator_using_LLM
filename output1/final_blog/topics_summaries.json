These initiatives are designed to address the diverse challenges faced by farmers, ranging from financial instability to inadequate infrastructure. The schemes cover a wide array of areas, including financial assistance, crop insurance, soil health management, and marketing reforms, all of which are crucial for promoting sustainable agricultural practices. By providing support throughout the farming cycle, the government aims to boost agricultural productivity, increase farm incomes, and alleviate rural distress.\n\nOne of the key schemes is the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN), which provides financial assistance to landholding farmers. Launched in 2019, it offers Rs 6000 annually in three instalments, directly transferred to farmers' bank accounts, thereby enhancing their financial stability. Another significant initiative is the Pradhan Mantri Kisan MaanDhan Yojana (PM-KMY), a contributory pension scheme for small and marginal farmers, ensuring a monthly pension of Rs 3,000 upon reaching the age of 60. Additionally, the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) offers comprehensive crop insurance to protect farmers against natural risks, with over 5549.40 lakh farmer applications insured since its inception in 2016.\n\nThe government has also launched the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF) to address infrastructure gaps and promote post-harvest management. This fund provides medium to long-term debt financing, with a total of Rs 1 lakh crore disbursed from FY 2020-21 to FY 2025-26. Furthermore, the formation and promotion of 10,000 Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) aim to enhance farmers' collective bargaining power and market access. The National Beekeeping and Honey Mission (NBHM) is another initiative under the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan, promoting scientific beekeeping to boost honey production. These schemes, along with the Market Intervention Scheme and Price Support Scheme (MIS-PSS), are part of a comprehensive strategy to safeguard farmers' interests and ensure their socio-economic empowerment.",

One such initiative is the Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY), which promotes organic farming to improve soil fertility and produce healthy food without the use of agro-chemicals. Implemented in clusters of 20 hectares, PKVY encourages farmers to adopt organic practices, with financial assistance provided to states and direct incentives to farmers. The program also facilitates the marketing of organic produce by consolidating clusters into larger units. This initiative is part of a broader effort to transition Indian agriculture towards more sustainable practices.\n\nAnother significant initiative is the Sub-Mission on Agriculture Mechanization (SMAM), which began in 2014 to accelerate the mechanization of Indian agriculture. SMAM aims to extend mechanization to small and marginal farmers, particularly in regions with low farm power availability. It promotes the establishment of Custom Hiring Centres to address the challenges of small landholdings and high equipment costs. The initiative has successfully distributed over 15 million pieces of agricultural machinery and equipment, established thousands of custom hiring centres, and conducted numerous awareness and capacity-building programs. SMAM also integrates Crop Residue Management (CRM) to curb air pollution and preserve soil nutrients by discouraging crop residue burning.\n\nIn addition to these, the government has launched several missions targeting specific agricultural sectors. The National Food Security Mission (NFSM) focuses on increasing the production of staple crops like rice, wheat, and pulses, while the National Mission on Edible Oils (NMEO)-Oil Palm aims to make India self-reliant in edible oils. The Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH) supports the holistic growth of the horticulture sector, and the National Bamboo Mission (NBM) focuses on developing the bamboo sector's value chain. These initiatives are complemented by digital agriculture efforts, such as the establishment of a digital public infrastructure for agriculture, which aims to provide farmers with access to information services for crop planning, market intelligence, and more. Collectively, these programs represent a comprehensive approach to transforming Indian agriculture into a more sustainable, productive, and farmer-centric sector.",
